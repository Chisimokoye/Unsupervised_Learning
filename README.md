# Unsupervised_Learning
In this assignment, I applied what you learnt about unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, created a visualization that shares your findings.

## This activity is broken down into four parts:

Part 1: Prepare the Data

Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction

Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means

Part 4: Make a Recommendation


## Final Visualisations

## Recommendation
Based on the above plots, i think the patients can be clustered(albeit not distinctly).
However, in event that the cluster is being considered, a cluster of 3 seems the most ideal.
